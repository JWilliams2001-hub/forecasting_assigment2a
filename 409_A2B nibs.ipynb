    "#### Question A\n",
    "At the January 28, 2026 meeting, the FOMC decided to hold the federal funds rate steady. The Comittee voted to \"leave our policy rate unchanged\". The target range was also maintained at 3.5% to 3.75%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision marks a pause in the easing cycle. Chair Powell noted that the Committee had \"lowered our policy rate by 75 basis points over the course of our previous three meetings\" (September, November, December 2025). This decision represents a shift to a monitoring phase."

    "#### Question B\n",
    "* In the meeting, the economy is described as expanding at a \"solid pace\". Powell notes a \"clear improvement in the outlook for growth\" since the last meeting in December. Furthermore, discussion regarding the GDP forecast now suggests that Q4 could have a 5% growth, driven by resilient consumption and \"fiscal tailwinds\" such as tax refunds and tariffs. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The Labor Market stabilizing was also a crucial pivot point. Powell states that data now suggests \"signs of stabilization\". The unemployment rate is 4.4%, and while job gains are low, they are no longer deteriorating rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With regards to inflation, the core PCE is at 3%, which is \"somewhat elevated\". However, Powell attributes the overshoot almost entirely to tariffs affecting the price of goods. He views this as a \"one-time price increase\" rather than a persistent inflation, noting that services disinflation is going to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Powell maintains a neutral policy stance, asserting the current rate (3.50%-3.75%) is \"within a range of plausible estimates of neutral\". Admitting that, \"it's hard to look at the incoming data and say that policy's significantly restrictive at this time\". This signals that the urgency to cut rates to avoid \"over-tightening\" is no longer significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With regards to timing signals, Powell emphasized they are \"well-positioned\" to wait and let the data \"light the way\". Specifically regarding inflation, he expects tariff effects to peak \"sometime in the middle quarters of the year\".\n"

    "#### Question C\n",
    "Taking into account everything that has been touched upon macro-econominally in the most recent FOMC meeting (5% GDP growth, stabilizing labor) colliding with the textual signals (waiting for the \"tariff hump\"), I predict the FOMC will Hold (Maintain Rates) at the next meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the Q&A, Powell stated they expect tariff-induced inflation to peak in the \"middle quarters of the year.\" March is too early to confirm this peak has passed. Powell explicitly said, \"if we see that... that would be something that tells us that we can... loosen policy\". The logical policy action is to hold until that data confirms the transitory nature of the price hikes.\n",
    "* Cutting rates into an economy potentially growing at 5% (with significant fiscal stimulus) violates standard Taylor Rule logic and risks re-igniting demand-pull inflation. As Powell noted, \"growth is on solid footing\". There is no recessionary pressure requiring immediate liquidity.\n",
    "* Finally, the primary justification for the previous 75bps of cuts was the rising downside risk to employment. By explicitly removing that language from the statement, the Fed has removed the rationale for consecutive cuts. Without renewed labor deterioration, the \"insurance\" phase is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, the newer neutral stance identified suggests a shift from active cutting to data-dependent holding. Unless labor market data crashes before March, the Fed will maintain the target range at 3.50% - 3.75%."
